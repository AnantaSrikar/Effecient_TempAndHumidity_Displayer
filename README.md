# Power Effecient Temperature and Humidity Displayer
## Project Description
Basically, the sensors work and show the values only when there's enough light for the user to see, the other times the sensor is switched off and reduces the power consumption of the device.
## Requirements
* Arduino (I used an UNO here)
* LDR module (To detect light, and then display the Temperature and Humidity)
* Temperature and Humidity module (I have used a DHT11 here)
